# todont
silly todo app written in python w/ sqlalchemy using sqlite

Work in progress

jupyter is me playing around with stuff.

So far I've got a basic db structure,  need to write things to:
* Create new todont entries
* Read/list current todont entries
* Mark todont entries as complete
* I think I want to make this like... a web interface eventually?
* idk
* we'll see
* it is called To Don't after all


# Is any of this right? idk, i'm pushing it here in case i lose my drive or something
# Does any of this work? yeah, I tested making a database for surez
